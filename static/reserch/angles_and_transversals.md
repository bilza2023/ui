When a transversal intersects with two parallel lines eight angles are produced.

figure55

The eight angles will together form four pairs of corresponding angles. Angles 1 and 5 constitutes one of the pairs. Corresponding angles are congruent. All angles that have the same position with regards to the parallel lines and the transversal are corresponding pairs e.g. 3 + 7, 4 + 8 and 2 + 6.

Angles that are in the area between the parallel lines like angle 2 and 8 above are called interior angles whereas the angles that are on the outside of the two parallel lines like 1 and 6 are called exterior angles.

Angles that are on the opposite sides of the transversal are called alternate angles e.g. 1 + 8.

All angles that are either exterior angles, interior angles, alternate angles or corresponding angles are all congruent.
