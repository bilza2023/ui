### âœ… **Definition of a Parallelogram**

A **parallelogram** is a quadrilateral (4-sided figure) in which **both pairs of opposite sides are parallel**.

Key properties:
Excellent â€” here is a clean explanation of **all key properties of a parallelogram**, with **2â€“3 lines per point**, perfectly suited for script or narration:

### âœ… Final List: Parallelogram Properties Explained

---

**1. Opposite sides are parallel and equal**
In any parallelogram, each pair of opposite sides is both **equal in length** and **runs parallel**. This gives the shape its name and symmetry.

---

**2. Opposite angles are equal**
Angles across from each other (like âˆ A and âˆ C) are always **equal** because they are formed by parallel lines and equal sides.

---

**3. Consecutive (adjacent) angles are supplementary**
Any two angles next to each other on a straight path add up to **180Â°**. This holds for all corner pairs, like âˆ A + âˆ B.

---

**4. If one angle is a right angle, all are right angles**
If even **one** of the four angles is **90Â°**, then by the angle rules, all other angles must also be **90Â°** â€” making it a rectangle.

---

**5. Diagonals bisect each other**
The two diagonals of a parallelogram cross at their **midpoints**, cutting each other exactly in **half**.

---

**6. Each diagonal forms two congruent triangles**
Drawing a diagonal splits the parallelogram into **two triangles** that are **equal in shape and size**.

---

**7. Parallelogram Law (Diagonal-Side Square Rule)**
The **sum of the squares of all four sides** equals the **sum of the squares of the diagonals**. This is known as the **parallelogram law** and is used in physics and vectors:

$$
AB^2 + BC^2 + CD^2 + DA^2 = AC^2 + BD^2
$$

### ðŸ§  **Relation to Triangles**

The **triangleâ€“parallelogram relationship** is deeply important in geometry. Hereâ€™s how they connect:

#### I. Diagonal of a Parallelogram â†’ Two Congruent Triangles

* When you draw a diagonal inside a parallelogram, it splits it into **two congruent triangles**.
* This forms the **basis of several theorems**, including proving triangle congruence using properties of parallelograms.

#### II. Triangle Area Trick

* A triangle is often thought of as **half a parallelogram**.
* This idea is used in area formulas:

  $$
  \text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
  $$

  â€” which comes from slicing a parallelogram in half.

#### III. Triangle Construction Inside Parallelograms

* Many **geometry proofs** use a triangle inside a parallelogram to demonstrate properties like:

  * Midpoint theorems
  * Congruent triangle rules (SAS, ASA)
  * Vector-based arguments

### ðŸ”— Summary Line

> A **parallelogram is the triangleâ€™s best friend in geometry** â€” it helps us form, prove, and break down triangles through symmetry, diagonals, and parallel reasoning.
