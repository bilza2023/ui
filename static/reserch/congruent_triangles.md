**Paragraph 1:**
Two triangles are said to be *congruent* when they have exactly the same size and shape. This means that all their corresponding sides are equal in length, and all their corresponding angles are equal in measure. When you place one triangle over the other, they match perfectly — no gaps, no overlaps. Congruence is a fundamental idea in geometry because it allows us to prove relationships between shapes with precision.

**Paragraph 2:**
To determine whether two triangles are congruent, we don’t always need to compare all six parts (three sides and three angles). Instead, certain combinations are enough. If two triangles satisfy any one of these four conditions — SAS, ASA, SSS, or RHS — then they are guaranteed to be congruent. These are called the triangle congruence theorems, and they form the basis of many geometric proofs and constructions.
