<h1>Theorem 11.1.4 ‚Äî Medians of a Triangle Are Concurrent</h1>

<p>
The <strong>medians</strong> of a triangle are line segments that connect each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Every triangle has exactly three medians.
</p>

<p>
This theorem states that all three medians of a triangle meet at a single point. This point is called the <strong>centroid</strong> of the triangle. Moreover, this point has a special property: it divides each median into two segments such that the segment from the vertex to the centroid is <em>twice as long</em> as the segment from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.
</p>

<p>
In other words, the medians are not just concurrent ‚Äî their point of concurrency is also the <strong>point of trisection</strong> for each median.

üîπ <strong>What does concurrent mean?</strong><br />
Concurrent lines are lines that <em>all intersect at a single point</em>. The length of the lines does not matter. They do not need to be equal or symmetrical. For example, the three medians of a triangle are concurrent because they all pass through one shared point ‚Äî the centroid.
</p>

<p>
‚ùå <strong>Concurrent</strong> does <strong>not</strong> mean <strong>congruent</strong>.<br />
Congruent lines are equal in length. Concurrent lines may or may not be congruent ‚Äî the key is that they meet at one point, not that they are the same.
</p>

<p>
üî∏ <strong>Point of Trisection:</strong><br />
This is a unique feature of triangle medians. The centroid divides each median in a fixed ratio of <strong>2:1</strong>. That means:
</p>

<p>
If you look at a median from vertex A to the midpoint of the opposite side BC, and the centroid lies on that line, then:
</p>

<p>
<span style="display: inline-block; padding-left: 2em;">AG = 2 √ó GD</span><br />
Where G is the centroid and D is the midpoint of BC.
</p>

<p>
This is true for all three medians in a triangle ‚Äî the centroid is always 2/3 of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
