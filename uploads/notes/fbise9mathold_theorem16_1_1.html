<h1>Theorem 16.1.1 – Triangles on the Same Base and Between the Same Parallels Have Equal Areas</h1>

<img src="/media/images/theorems9old_16.1.1.svg" alt="Two triangles sharing a base and lying between the same parallels" style="max-width:50%;">

<h2>Book Statement</h2>
<p>Triangles on the same base and between the same parallels are equal in area.</p>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Same base:</strong> Two triangles share a common side as their base.</li>
  <li><strong>Between the same parallels:</strong> The base lies on one line and the other vertices lie on another line parallel to the base.</li>
  <li><strong>Altitude (height):</strong> The perpendicular distance from a vertex to the line containing the base.</li>
  <li><strong>Area of a triangle:</strong> Given by <em>\(\tfrac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If triangles <em>ABC</em> and <em>ADC</em> share base <em>AC</em> and the points <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> lie on a line parallel to <em>AC</em>, then <em>[△ABC] = [△ADC]</em>.</p>

<h2>What We Will Prove</h2>
<ol>
  <li>For triangles on the same base <em>AC</em> and between the same parallels, their perpendicular heights to <em>AC</em> are equal.</li>
  <li>Using the area formula, equal base and equal height imply equal areas.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Detailed Proof</h2>

<h3>Step&nbsp;1 – Common Height from Parallels</h3>
<p>Let triangles <em>ABC</em> and <em>ADC</em> share base <em>AC</em>. Suppose the line through <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> is parallel to <em>AC</em>. The perpendicular distance from that line to <em>AC</em> is constant everywhere, so the altitudes from <em>B</em> and <em>D</em> to <em>AC</em> are equal; call this common height <em>h</em>.</p>

<h3>Step&nbsp;2 – Write the Areas</h3>
<p><em>[△ABC] = \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)·AC·h</em> and <em>[△ADC] = \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)·AC·h</em>, since both use the same base <em>AC</em> and the same height <em>h</em>.</p>

<h3>Step&nbsp;3 – Conclude Equality</h3>
<p>Therefore, <em>[△ABC] = [△ADC]</em>, which proves that triangles on the same base and between the same parallels have equal areas.</p>
