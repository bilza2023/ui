<h1>Theorem 16.1.4 – Triangles with Equal Altitudes Have Areas Proportional to Their Bases</h1>

<img src="/media/images/theorems9old_16.1.4.svg" alt="Two triangles sharing equal heights but different bases" style="max-width:50%;">

<h2>Book Statement</h2>
<p>Triangles with equal altitudes have areas proportional to their corresponding bases.</p>

<h2>Key Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Altitude (height):</strong> The perpendicular drawn from a vertex to the line containing the base.</li>
  <li><strong>Base:</strong> The side of the triangle to which the altitude is drawn.</li>
  <li><strong>Area ratio:</strong> When heights are equal, the ratio of areas equals the ratio of bases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Symbolically, if two triangles have the same altitude <em>h</em> and respective bases <em>b₁</em> and <em>b₂</em>, then <em>[△₁]/[△₂] = b₁/b₂</em>.</p>

<h2>What We Will Prove</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Both triangles share the same perpendicular height to their bases.</li>
  <li>Using the area formula <em>\(\tfrac{1}{2}\times \text{base} \times \text{height}\)</em>, the ratio of areas equals the ratio of bases.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Detailed Proof</h2>

<h3>Step&nbsp;1 – Common Height</h3>
<p>Let the two triangles have bases of lengths <em>b₁</em> and <em>b₂</em> and share the same perpendicular distance (altitude) <em>h</em> to those bases.</p>

<h3>Step&nbsp;2 – Express the Areas</h3>
<p>Their areas are <em>[△₁] = \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)·b₁·h</em> and <em>[△₂] = \(\tfrac{1}{2}\)·b₂·h</em>.</p>

<h3>Step&nbsp;3 – Compare the Areas</h3>
<p>Therefore,
<em>\([△₁]/[△₂] = (\tfrac{1}{2} b₁ h)/(\tfrac{1}{2} b₂ h) = b₁/b₂\)</em>, proving that triangles with equal altitudes have areas proportional to their bases.</p>
