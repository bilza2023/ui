# ⭐ **FINAL ICON RULES (LOCKED)**

_(94 fixed icons → each represents a Qur’anic word root → nothing else)_

## **1. Icons represent WORD OCCURRENCE — not meaning**

Icons are **not translations**, not summaries, not metaphors.

They simply indicate:

✔ “This Qur’anic word (or its exact root variant) appears in this āyah.”

That’s all.

---

## **2. Use icon ONLY if that exact Qur’anic word is in the āyah**

No word → no icon.
No close meaning → no icon.
No interpretation → no icon.

Example:

- Word **بَرْق** appears → ⚡ allowed
- Word **سَمْع** appears → 👂 allowed
- Word **أَبْصَار** appears → 👁️ allowed
- Word **شَيْطَان** does NOT appear → 😈 NOT allowed

---

## **3. Never invent new icons**

Never create icons for:

✘ ideas
✘ themes
✘ emotions
✘ scenes
✘ “public face / private face”
✘ “people meeting”
✘ “walking in rain”
✘ “fear”

Only use icons from the **94-icon fixed library**.

---

## **4. Never add an icon just to decorate**

✔ If 1 icon applies, use 1.
✔ If 2 apply, use 2.
✘ Do NOT try to fill space.
✘ Do NOT force an icon if the word is not present.

---

## **5. OK to have zero icons**

If no root from the 94 icons appears:

→ **Use hook + story only.**
→ The āyah is still fully memorizable.

Icons are **helpers**, not requirements.

---

## **6. Icons ≠ full story — story is separate**

- **Icons = the Qur’anic words**
- **Hook = the physical location**
- **Story = glues everything together**

Story may include:

✔ rain
✔ darkness
✔ walls
✔ jumping
✔ shaking
✔ glowing
✔ climbing

…but **the icon remains the anchor**.

Example:
⚡ is the anchor → story can add thunder, water, clouds — but **icon = word**, not story.

---

## **7. Use minimum icons (1–3)**

Icons should be **sharp**, **light**, and **word-based**.

Not heavy, not crowded.

---

## **8. Do NOT stretch meanings or use “symbolic” icons**

Example mistakes:

❌ Using 🎭 (Munafiq) for “double face” when the word doesn’t appear
❌ Using 🤝 (Wali/ally) for “meeting believers” — wrong root
❌ Using 👥 (Ummah) for “people” — wrong root
❌ Using 🍞 (Rizq) for “food” when رزق is not used

---

## **9. Icon order must follow the word order in the āyah**

Maintain Qur’anic sequence:

1st word → 1st icon
2nd word → 2nd icon
etc.

---

## **10. Icons must stay PURE**

Each icon keeps only **ONE Islamic meaning**:

🕯️ = إِيمَان (iman)
💣 = كَذِب (lying)
🧭 = ضلال (misguidance)
🍞 = رزق (sustenance)
🌍 = دنيا (this world)
⚡ = عذاب (punishment)
🕋 = صلاة (prayer)
🌑 = ظلمات (darkness)
👂 = سمع (hearing)
👁️ = بصر (seeing)
☣️ = فساد (corruption)
…etc.

No mixing. No combining.
