# Rules for Story Creation  
(Memory Palace – Visual Qur’an)

---

## 1. Core Definition
The **story is not meaning**.  
The **story is the glue between visible things**.

Its only job is to help the mind:
- notice the image  
- connect parts of the image  
- linger on the image  

If the image disappears, the story must collapse.

---

## 2. Absolute Principle
> **Images store memory. Stories only activate images.**

If a story can be remembered without the image, it is too strong and must be weakened.

---

## 3. Architectural Order (CRITICAL)
Always design in this order:

**Surah → Ayah Groups → Scene Roles → Visual Props**

Never design scenes ayah-by-ayah in isolation.  
Visuals are **structural**. Ayahs are **textual**.

---

## 4. Ayah-Level Encoding Rule
> **At ayah level: no Arabic, no words — only props and visuals.**

Arabic, meaning, tafsir, and narration are **retrieval layers**, not encoding layers.

---

## 5. Shape Over Meaning
> **Do not encode meaning. Encode shape. Meaning will arrive on its own.**

If an ayah:
- lists 6 things → use a structure with 6 positions  
- contrasts 2 sides → split the scene into two regions  
- builds step-by-step → use a linear or layered structure  

**One dominant idea = one dominant structure.**

Additional elements may exist **only to connect forward**, never to add meaning.

---

## 6. Mental Posture
- The observer **witnesses**, not acts  
- The observer **looks**, not explains  
- The observer **moves attention**, not objects  

Think: *slow walking, slow looking, quiet noticing*.

---

## 7. What the Story IS Allowed to Do
The story may:
- describe shapes, colors, size, symmetry  
- connect visible objects to each other  
- trace paths already drawn in the image  
- revisit the same object from another visual angle  
- move the observer’s focus (eye movement only)  

The story may take time, but must remain image-bound.

---

## 8. What the Story is NOT Allowed to Do
The story must NOT:
- explain meaning  
- resolve interpretation  
- invent events  
- animate objects  
- teach doctrine  
- replace the image
