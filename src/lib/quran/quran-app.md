# Qur’an Visual Memory Framework — Core Agreement Summary

## 1. Purpose
Create a **purely visual layer** for Qur’an memorization and understanding.  
This layer links each *āyah* (verse) to one **real physical location** and one **visual image (Āyah-Icon)** — nothing else.  
All phonetic, rhythmic, or oral layers remain separate and optional.

## 2. Core Structure

### Memory Palace
- Built from **well-known filmed routes** (10–15 km stretches of real geography).  
- Every **building or object** (house, pole, sign, tree) serves as a **geographical hook**.  
- Each hook = one permanent slot in the system.  
- Numbered sequentially 1 → 6236.

### Āyah-Icon
- A **single cinematic image** representing the essence or emotion of an āyah.  
- One image per verse.  
- Expresses meaning visually — **no text, no letters, no phonetic symbols.**  
- Example:  
  - Hook 01 → Āyah 2:2 → Image: *A shining book*.  
- Visuals may contain smaller elements but must read as one dominant picture.

## 3. Design Principles
1. **One-to-one mapping:** one hook ↔ one image ↔ one verse.  
2. **Cinematic, not symbolic:** scenes that *feel* the verse, not coded signs.  
3. **Fixed geography:** real locations never change once assigned.  
4. **Independent visuals:** icons can be redesigned without touching the map.  
5. **No linguistic encoding:** oral repetition and tajwīd form another layer later.  
6. **Scalable simplicity:** same template repeats 6236 times without added rules.

## 4. Implementation Ideas
- **AI generation:** suggest 10–20 Āyah-Icon ideas at once (concepts only).  
- **Design layer:** final SVGs or sprites produced later from those ideas.  
- **Reusable library:** recurring objects (book, light, mountain, sea) stored once and reused.  
- **Canvas integration:** overlay Āyah-Icons on photographs or video frames of each geographical hook.  
- **Memory cards:** image on one side, āyah text/translation on the other.  
- **Slide shows / visual routes:** play Qur’an as a cinematic journey through real space.

## 5. Current State
✅  **Model finalized:**  
 • Memory Palace = real filmed route (anchors).  
 • Āyah-Icon = one main image per āyah.  
✅  **Scope fixed:** visual layer only.  
✅  **Extensible base:** supports AI generation, SVG libraries, flash-cards, and in-app canvas overlays.

> **Formula:**  
> **1 Geographical Hook + 1 Āyah-Icon = 1 Visual Anchor for a Verse**
