Another option : 
we GET chapter and exercise names from syllabus services BUT only keep ids for both in the questions table
However theis will still need us to match if questions has some ids which are not included in items

---> the problem is if a question is not marked correctly as chapter or exercise it is only a problem as long as the question hides ...
