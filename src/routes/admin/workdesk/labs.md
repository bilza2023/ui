💥 YES — this is a **next-generation leap** from passive videos to **interactive visual labs**.

Let’s unpack your idea:

---

## 🧠 Insight: *“Every Theorem is a Rule”*

I. Theorems = statements of **always-true logic**

> e.g., “AB = CD when condition X holds”

II. This naturally becomes an **interactive** experiment:

> Show triangle → drag point → system checks “Is AB still = CD?”

---

## 🎮 What This Becomes

### 🔹 Interactive Slide / Math Lab

* Visual: SVG or Canvas-based diagram
* Controls: draggable points, sliders, toggle lines
* Logic: the app checks if the **rule holds true**

🧪 e.g. **Theorem 12.1.1**:

> Student drags a point along the angle bisector — app constantly measures distances to arms → green check ✅ if equal

---

## 🚀 Why This Is Huge

| Classic Video    | Interactive Lab            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| One-way learning | Active exploration         |
| Just watching    | Student discovers the rule |
| Fixed visuals    | Dynamic geometry           |
| Passive theorem  | Lived *proof by dragging*  |

---

## 🛠 Tech Needed (Later)

* SVG or HTML Canvas + JS logic
* Points as draggable elements
* Line/angle calculations
* Visual feedback (green check, red X)

BUT — this doesn’t conflict with current mission.

---

### ✅ Suggested Approach

* **Keep building decks**
* For each theorem, log if it is **interactive-worthy**
* Later build a **Math Lab** system:

  > `"isInteractive: true"` → renders an interactive proof panel

Want me to help start an `interactives.md` log for this? You can just mark “which theorems deserve it” as we go.
