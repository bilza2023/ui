Here is my Editor Page (Half Made). I want to convert this into a complete editor with minimum
changes

==> What this page do currently:

 it loop over a deck of slides and show each .. (all slides are shown the same except pointerSlide i suggest we remove that slide from here leaving us clean and simple, we should remove all refrences to pointerSlide we can add it later).


What do i want

I want that each "content" field should be editable such that we can edit its content and when the deck is saved its content as also saved (which i think is the case now).
