# Triangle Congruence Postulates and Theorems â€“ Class 9, Chapter 10

---

Theorem 10.1.1
**ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)**
If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

---

Theorem 10.1.2
**â€”no name**
If two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite to these angles are also equal.

---

Theorem 10.1.3
**SSS (Side-Side-Side)**
If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

---

Theorem 10.1.4
**HS (Hypotenuse Side)**
In right-angled triangles, if the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

---
If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and included side of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

## âœ… Theorem 10.1.2 â€” Summary (Isosceles Triangle)

**Statement:**  
If two angles of a triangle are equal, then the sides opposite to these angles are also equal.

**ðŸ”¹ Condensed Major Steps:**

**Step 1:**  
Let \( \angle B = \angle C \) in triangle \( \triangle ABC \).  
We aim to prove \( AB = AC \), i.e., the sides opposite equal angles are themselves equal.

**Step 2:**  
Draw a line from vertex \( A \) to midpoint \( D \) on base \( BC \).  
Use the **SAS Postulate** to show \( \triangle ABD \cong \triangle ACD \).

**Step 3:**  
By **CPCTC** (corresponding parts of congruent triangles), we conclude \( AB = AC \).  
Hence, sides opposite equal angles are equal.

## âœ… Theorem 10.1.3 â€” Summary (SSS Congruence)

**Statement:**
In the correspondence of two triangles, if three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.

**ðŸ”¹ Condensed Major Steps:**

**Step 1:**
Prove $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle EFM$ using the **SAS Postulate**, based on constructed triangle $\triangle EFM$ having same side lengths and included angles as $\triangle ABC$.

**Step 2:**
Since $\triangle EFM \cong \triangle DEF$ (same shape, same position), apply **transitivity of congruence** to conclude:
$\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$

**âˆ´ Theorem Proved.**

## âœ… Theorem 10.1.4 â€” Summary (Hypotenuse-Side Congruence)

**Statement:**  
In right-angled triangles, if the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

**ðŸ”¹ Condensed Major Steps:**

**Step 1:**  
Consider two right-angled triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \) with right angles at \( C \) and \( F \).  
Given: \( AB = DE \) (hypotenuse) and \( AC = DF \) (one side).

**Step 2:**  
Using the **RHS Congruence Rule** (Right angleâ€“Hypotenuseâ€“Side),  
we conclude \( \triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF \).

**âˆ´ Theorem Proved.**
