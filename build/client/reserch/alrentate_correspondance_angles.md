## ✅ MASTER EXPLANATION — FOR YOU

These are the **5 angle types** formed when a **transversal** cuts two **parallel lines**. All references are to the uploaded `angles.jpg`.

---

### 1. **Alternate Interior Angles** (Purple)

* **Where:** Inside the parallel lines, on **opposite sides** of the transversal.
* **Property:** They are **equal** (congruent).
* **Example:** Think of a **'Z' shape** inside the lines — those two inner corners form alternate interior angles.

---

### 2. **Alternate Exterior Angles** (Blue)

* **Where:** Outside the parallel lines, on **opposite sides** of the transversal.
* **Property:** They are **equal** (congruent).
* **Example:** Imagine a **'Z' shape** formed *outside* the parallel lines — those two corners are alternate exterior.

### 3. **Corresponding Angles** (Yellow)

* **Where:** Same side of the transversal, **same position** at each intersection (e.g., top-left with top-left).
* **Property:** They are **equal** (congruent).
* **Example:** Think of an **'F' shape** — corresponding angles sit in the same “slot” on each parallel.

---

### 4. **Same-Side Interior (Co-Interior) Angles** (Orange)

* **Where:** Inside the parallel lines, on the **same side** of the transversal.
* **Property:** They are **supplementary** — they **add to 180°**.
* **Example:** These angles form a **'U' shape** inside the lines.

---

### 5. **Same-Side Exterior Angles** (Green)

* **Where:** Outside the parallel lines, on the **same side** of the transversal.
* **Property:** They are also **supplementary** — they **add to 180°**.
* **Example:** These mirror the orange 'U' shape, but located **outside** the parallels.
