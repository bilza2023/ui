    it divides those two sides proportionally.</p> <h2>Key Vocabulary</h2> <ul><li><strong>Parallel Lines:</strong> Lines in a plane that never meet.</li> <li><strong>Transversal:</strong> A line that intersects two or more other lines.</li> <li><strong>Proportional Segments:</strong> Two ratios that are equal.</li></ul> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Draw any triangle. Place a ruler parallel to its base, touching the other sides.
    The two segments you cut off have the same ratio as the original sides.</p> <h2>What We Will Prove</h2> <ol><li>The intercepted segments on the two sides form equal ratios.</li></ol> <h2>Proof Road-Map (Top-Level Steps)</h2> <table><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>Core Idea</th><th>Tool / Theorem Used</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Create two similar triangles</td><td>Parallel-line angle equality</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Establish equal corresponding side ratios</td><td>Definition of similarity</td></tr></tbody></table> <img src="/images/theorems9old_14.1.1.svg" alt="Same diagram re-shown before detailed proof" style="max-width:50%;"/> <h2>Detailed Proof</h2> <h3>Step 1 – Identify Similar Triangles</h3> <p>…</p> <h3>Step 2 – Equate Corresponding Sides</h3> <p>…</p> <hr/> <small>Generated 2025-08-06.</small>`,n;return s=new C({}),{c(){t=u("link"),i=g(),L(s.$$.fragment),l=g(),a=u("main"),a.innerHTML=m,this.h()},l(e){const r=q("svelte-k308dd",document.head);t=p(r,"LINK",{rel:!0,href:!0}),r.forEach(o),i=c(e),x(s.$$.fragment,e),l=c(e),a=p(e,"MAIN",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),k(a)!=="svelte-ljkm9"&&(a.innerHTML=m),this.h()},h(){d(t,"rel","stylesheet"),d(t,"href","/data/css/notes.css"),d(a,"class","notes")},m(e,r){P(document.head,t),h(e,i,r),$(s,e,r),h(e,l,r),h(e,a,r),n=!0},p:w,i(e){n||(b(s.$$.fragment,e),n=!0)},o(e){S(s.$$.fragment,e),n=!1},d(e){e&&(o(i),o(l),o(a)),o(t),T(s,e)}}}class E extends _{constructor(t){super(),y(this,t,null,I,v,{})}}export{E as component};
