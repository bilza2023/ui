# 🧠 Project Wind-Up Summary — Taleem.Help
_August 2025_

---

## ✅ System Overview

### 📦 App Roles

- The current app will be called **`be` (backend edition)** — the full admin + content control panel.
- A separate stripped-down frontend version (**`ui`**) will handle only: Home, Syllabus, Player, Notes.

---

### 📘 Syllabus System

- Format is finalized (`syllabus-v1`)
- Pure JSON structure — used by UI for rendering
- Each syllabus item is linked by a unique `filename`
- Two active types: `note`, `slide` (a.k.a. `question`)
- Content is visually rendered differently per type

---

### 🧾 Deck System

- `deck-v1` schema is frozen
- All slide types stable (including pointer, EQ, image)
- Player is stable
- Decks can be played directly from JSON

---

### 📄 Notes System

- Markdown is fully deprecated
- All notes are static `.svelte` files
- Notes use embedded HTML and inline KaTeX
- Images are pre-created (SVGs) and referenced statically

---

### 🧨 Content Production Status

| Content Type | Status        | Blockers                    |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Notes        | ✅ Ready       | None                        |
| Silent Decks | ⚠ Optional     | Needs final testing         |
| Full Decks   | 🔧 Blocked     | Needs `.json` timing editor |

---

## 🧩 Critical Concepts

- Use of **filename = identity anchor** across all content types
- All assets (image, audio) are file-based
- Deck and Notes share a unified connection via syllabus
- Player and Timing tools are becoming file-driven instead of DB-driven

---

## 📋 TODOs for Launch Readiness

### 📁 Structure & Syllabus
- [ ] Split `syllabus.json` → multiple subject files
- [ ] Add `syllabus-v1` Zod schema
- [ ] Update `syllabus.md` to reflect:
  - New formats
  - Supported content types (`note`, `slide`)
  - Future expansion (`deck`)
  - Per-subject JSON
- [ ] Keep homepage manually curated with subject list

### 🧪 Health Scripts
- [ ] Add `check:syllabus` (Zod validation)
- [ ] Add `check:decks` (schema check)
- [ ] Add `check:notes` (broken link detection)
- [ ] Add `healthCheck`:
  - Check for missing sound/image/svg per deck

### 🖼 Image Infrastructure
- [ ] Generate full list of image assets:
  - From `/static/images`
  - From all deck JSONs (✅ easy)
  - From all notes `.svelte` files (⚠ needs regex/HTML scan)

### 🎧 Deck Playback Prep
- [ ] Finalize support for silent decks
- [ ] Make sure player doesn't break if `soundUrl = null`

### ⏱ Timing Tool Refactor
- [ ] Update timings page to:
  - Upload `.json` deck
  - Edit timings
  - Save to `.json` or `.meta.js`

## 🏁 Closing Thought

> "If `deck-v1` schema hadn't been frozen, the whole system would be unstable."  
> Now it’s stable. No new experiments. Just content.

Let the floodgates open soon.
