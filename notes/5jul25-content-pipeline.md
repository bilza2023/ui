Understood. Listening and documenting. Here are your setup notes exactly as described, clarified where necessary:

---

## 📒 Node-Hero + UI App: Finalized Setup Flow

### 1. **Syllabus Creation Happens in Node-Hero**

* You define the syllabus in the admin dashboard.
* This includes creating:

  * **Tcodes** (top-level syllabus)
  * **Chapters** under each Tcode
  * **Exercises** under each Chapter
  * **Questions** under each Exercise
* At this stage, **question content is empty**.

---

### 2. **Question Content Is Uploaded Separately as Files**

* Content files are stored manually under the `files/` directory in Node-Hero.
* Each file contains one question’s content.
* The file format is `deckbuilder` format — i.e. JavaScript arrays of `name/content` items, not raw JSON.

---

### 3. **`load-content` Script Loads Files into SQLite DB**

* This script reads each content file.
* It parses the deckbuilder-style format.
* It converts it to clean JSON and stores it in the `content` field of the corresponding `Question` in SQLite.

---

### 4. **Deck Format is Transformed to JSON**

* DeckBuilder input (JavaScript-style files) → parsed → stored in DB as pure JSON.
* This enables the player to consume the data as static JSON slides.

---

### 5. **SQLite DB Is Copied to UI App**

* Once the DB is ready and populated, you manually or via script:

  * Move `dev.db` from Node-Hero (admin backend)
  * Into the `db/` folder of the SvelteKit-based UI app
* The UI app reads directly from SQLite.
* It has no logic or transformation — it is a **pure shell**:

  * Reads from DB
  * Renders what exists

---
Here’s the clean, final version:

---

## 🧩 UI App = Pure Shell

The UI is a **static shell** that reads from a local SQLite database and renders content. It does not generate, transform, or sync anything.

### ✅ To update the content:

1. **Upload DB file:**
   Use FileZilla to replace `ui/db/dev.db`

2. **Upload assets:**
   Place images and sounds in the appropriate `static/` folders inside `ui/`

3. **Restart the app:**

   ```bash
   pm2 restart all
   ```

That’s it.
No deploy scripts. No build steps. Just update files + restart = system updated.
