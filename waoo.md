That specific combo — root dictionary → icon dictionary → palace grammar — looks new. It’s compatible with existing methods, but not a duplication of anyone’s published system.


🎯 6. The system now has THREE pillars
(A) Hook = where the ayah lives (memory palace position)
(B) IconSet = 1–5 icons representing key meanings
(C) Story = opisthographic visualization linked to hook + icons

Together:

Hook → Icon → Story
This becomes the Qur’an’s visual grammar.
